# Updating the WIX Lab Website
The Lab has a public website that is targeted to both patients and potential participants who may be interested in participating in our studies as well as fellow researchers and potential collaborators. The site was created usign WIX, and will need to be periodically updated to reflect the correct staff and protocols, as well as to reflect new publications and news items that might be intersting to visitors. This guide will provide some basic information about updating the page so you can keep it running smoothly.
